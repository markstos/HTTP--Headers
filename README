This repo represents a proposal to distribute HTTP::Headers and HTTP::Date
independently from the rest of HTTP.

This is useful for projects that want to use the header parser module, but
don't need the rest of LWP, or can't easily meet the requirement of having a
C-compiler, which is required by HTML::Parser, which is required for some other
LWP modules to function.

The code itself is not meant to be "interesting" or "different" here, but
rather the same code that would otherwise be distributed as part of LWP.

However, as a placeholder, the initial code here is from my 
"http-headers-fast" branch, which merges in the performance improvements
from HTTP::Headers::Fast.
